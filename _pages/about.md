At pBoDS Lab, we aim to understand space and time mechanisms of patterning in vertebrate embryonic tissues. For this purpose, we combine 1- quantitative state-of-art microscopy, 2- single cell level analysis of signal dynamics, and 3- data-informed predictive modeling of systems level biophysics.

Zebrafish with its translucent, accessible, and multiplexed early embryonic development as well as tractable genetics is our favorite model organism!

Our research vision is inquiring about the conserved mechanisms of sequential segmentation across vertebrates and design principles of morphogen positional information in embryos. We are located at <a href="http://biology.mcmaster.ca" target="_blank">McMaster University</a>.

pBODS Lab has opened in January, 2024!
			If you are interested in joining pBODS lab, please send us an email including three things:
			1- your CV,
			2- a brief description of your past research exposure,
			3- a brief answer for "what did you find interesting in this lab and how does it align with your future plans?"
   
Undergraduate students:
Please inquire about joining the lab for the fullfilment of 3rd and 4th year independent research projects and theses.
        
Prospective graduate students:
Please apply through <u><a href="https://gs.mcmaster.ca" target="_blank">the School of Graduate Studies</a></u> for either Master's or Ph.D. admission.
